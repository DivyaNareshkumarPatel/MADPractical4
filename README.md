# Kotlin Alarm App

##AIM: Create an Android Alarm application by using service & BroadcastReceiver.

This Kotlin Android application demonstrates the usage of various Android components such as `BroadcastReceiver`, `Service`, `TextClock`, `TimePickerDialog`, `PendingIntent`, `AlarmManager`, and `MediaPlayer` to create a simple alarm application. The app allows users to set alarms, view the current time, and receive notifications when alarms go off.

## Features

- **BroadcastReceiver**: Receives broadcast messages from the system or other applications to perform actions like triggering alarms.
- **Service**: Runs background tasks, such as playing an alarm sound when an alarm goes off, using `startService()` and `stopService()`.
- **TextClock**: Displays the current time dynamically within the app.
- **TimePickerDialog**: Allows users to select a time for setting an alarm.
- **SimpleDateFormat Class**: Formats date and time strings to make them user-friendly.
- **PendingIntent**: Creates an intent that will be executed in the future, used for setting alarms.
- **AlarmManager**: Schedules alarms that trigger `BroadcastReceiver` at specified times.
- **MediaPlayer**: Plays audio files, such as alarm sounds.
- **MaterialCardView**: A Material Design component that provides a card-like interface for displaying content.
